**Xianxia Text based game**

A text-based game discussing the environment and political consequences surrounding it. The player is expected to make hard choices that require them to suffer in order to obtain the ending they desire. Doing nothing would lead to ruin.

The world is a fantasy Cultivation world with Cultivators and Sects organized around them. Cultivators harvest their resources from mountains and have inherent powers known as Qi. The resources are used to improve their strength in their overall goal to defy the heavens. 

Set in a world where a revolution took place, displacing the Cultivators from their positions in power, cultivators are forced to return to the mortal world and work together to resolve environmental issues.
